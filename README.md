# Radius Sanding Machine

The radius sanding machine is designed to solve the tiring process of sanding a radius into your bracing, as well as the sides of the guitar.  It makes quick work of a job that typically takes a lot of time and energy.

### Build Notes
- Your motor mount plate will vary depending on your specific motor.  I've listed the dimensions used in this build as a reference.
- The motor mount plate is hinged to allow for belt tensioning.  Hinge on the side towards the middle of the machine and use a screw/bolt on the opposing side as a tensioner.
